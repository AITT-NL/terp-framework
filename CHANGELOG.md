# Changelog

All notable changes to the Terp platform. Terp releases **in lockstep**: every backend
distribution (`terp-core`, `terp-arch`, `terp-cli`, `terp-migrations`, `terp-cap-*`) and
every frontend package (`@terp/contract`, `@terp/react-core`, `@terp/eslint-boundaries`,
`@terp/conformance`) carries the same version and publishes from the same tag
(`v<version>`); the gate enforces the lockstep (`tests/architecture/test_release_versions.py`).

The full rationale trail lives in [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/) — one ADR per
decision, 0001 onwards.

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First tagged release of the platform: the secure-by-default backend kernel
(`terp.core`), the base-profile + opt-in capabilities, the `terp.arch` enforcement
harness, the `terp` CLI, packaged per-package Alembic migrations, the frontend contract
(`@terp/contract`) and the first frontend stack (`@terp/react-core` + boundary lint +
conformance suite), the copier client template, the Docker dev workbench, and the
production deployment profile (multi-stage wheel images + hardened compose profile +
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`). See ADRs 0001–0082, including the new `terp-cap-redis` shared-store adapters for Redis-backed idempotency, throttling, and cache state.
