# Changelog

All notable changes to the Terp platform. Terp releases **in lockstep**: every backend
distribution (`terp-core`, `terp-arch`, `terp-cli`, `terp-migrations`, `terp-cap-*`) and
every frontend package (`@terp/contract`, `@terp/react-core`, `@terp/eslint-boundaries`,
`@terp/conformance`) carries the same version and publishes from the same tag
(`v<version>`); the gate enforces the lockstep (`tests/architecture/test_release_versions.py`).

The full rationale trail lives in [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/) — one ADR per
decision, 0001 onwards.

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First tagged release of the platform: the secure-by-default backend kernel
(`terp.core`), the base-profile + opt-in capabilities, the `terp.arch` enforcement
harness, the `terp` CLI, packaged per-package Alembic migrations, the frontend contract
(`@terp/contract`) and the first frontend stack (`@terp/react-core` + boundary lint +
conformance suite), the copier client template, the Docker dev workbench, and the
production deployment profile (multi-stage wheel images + hardened compose profile +
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`). See ADRs 0001–0082, including the new `terp-cap-redis` shared-store adapters for Redis-backed idempotency, throttling, and cache state.

Late additions on the unreleased line:

- **Centralized first-run frontend design system.** `@terp/react-core` now owns
  stable control typography and intrinsic button sizing, icon-only themed
  preference menus, body-portaled/clamped overlays, normalized number inputs,
  compact page headers, equal-track `HubCard`s, and record-labelled DataView
  navigation. `AppShell` now has a home-linked brand, fixed-size collapsed icon
  slots, a scrollbar-free rail, and a scroll-locked/focus-contained mobile
  drawer; its `renderLink` receives an additive third context argument with the
  framework-owned expanded/collapsed styles (existing two-argument callbacks
  remain valid), and `renderBrandLink` is optional. Packaged users/groups admin
  now follows overview -> dedicated create/detail routes with breadcrumbs,
  page actions and confirmation-gated destructive changes. Nested `HubPage`s
  accept `parents`; the inherited `breadcrumbs` prop remains a compatibility
  alias.
- **`terp verify` — the one-command gate over declared profiles.** The project's
  whole verification surface as data: `--profile quick` (static enforcement:
  architecture gate, boundary lint, typecheck), `full` (the merge bar: + backend
  tests, the delegated AppSec baseline, the production build — exactly the
  template CI's blocking checks), `release` (+ API-docs drift, black-box
  conformance). `--list` prints the manifest a driving tool configures its gate
  from (id, category, command, input scope per check); `--only <check>` runs a
  subset (the change-scoped rerun seam); `--format json` emits the `terp_verify`
  envelope with every Terp Standard check report the checks published carried
  structurally.
- **Check reports (Terp Standard v0.7.0, `app-check-report.schema.json`).**
  `terp check --format check-report` and `terp-boundaries-lint --format
  check-report` emit the spec's self-describing check report — the certified
  `spec_version`, the checker identity, the run verdict, the evaluated-rule
  inventory as catalog ids, and findings in the finding format's shape
  (`fix_hint` = the `terp guide` recipe) — so a consumer joins per-rule verdicts
  to the catalog through one contract on both surfaces. The legacy
  `--format json` report and `terp_findings` envelope keep their published
  shapes; the certified spec version is a build-time constant
  (`terp.arch.SPEC_VERSION`, `SPEC_VERSION` in `@terp/eslint-boundaries`) held
  equal to the pinned spec release by the framework gate.
- **App-declared environment variables.** Every app ships an
  `environment.schema.json` manifest (empty by default) declaring the run-time
  variables it reads beyond the platform-owned set; both compose profiles
  forward the declared keys through one optional `env_file` seam (`.app.env`,
  `required: false`, gitignored/dockerignored). Deploy pipelines render exactly
  the declared keys — undeclared variables stay impossible, secret-marked ones
  stay out of plain records. Guarded by `test_prod_profile.py` /
  `test_compose_workbench.py`.
- **Per-rule verdicts are joinable to the Terp Standard (ADR 0083).**
  `terp check --format json` now publishes `rules` — the evaluated-rule
  inventory that matches the execution mode (the live registry; the budget
  ratchet only when a budget was supplied) — so a driving tool (the Studio's
  spec matrix) can join verdicts to catalog ids without ever claiming "pass"
  for a rule the pinned toolchain never ran. On the frontend, the new
  `terp-boundaries-lint` bin (the analog of `terp check --format json`)
  replaces the `eslint . && terp-boundaries-budget` chain: it runs the app's
  own ESLint config **and** the escape-hatch budget ratchet in one command
  (both halves always run — drift can no longer hide behind a failing lint)
  and publishes one findings envelope on stdout — the evaluated inventory
  (`catalogRuleIds()`), a `not_applicable` list for opt-in rules the app has
  not enabled (`frontend/layout-contract` without a checked-in
  `layout-contract.json`), findings attributed to stack-neutral catalog ids
  via `catalogRuleId` (budget drift as `frontend/escape-hatch`), and an
  `unattributed` bucket that is surfaced, never dropped — while the human
  report stays on stderr. `terp-boundaries-budget --format json` emits the
  same envelope standalone. The template and example lint script is now
  `terp-boundaries-lint`.

- **The two-layer doctrine is classified per rule (ADR 0084, Terp Standard
  v0.5.0).** Every catalog entry now carries a mandatory, machine-checked
  `runtime.applicability` (`required` / `not-applicable` / `deferred`): 21
  rules declare their fail-closed runtime control (15 controls that already
  existed — the write-chokepoint strip, the session re-scope, the boot
  validators, the catalog chokepoints — are now *declared* instead of
  folklore), 31 source-form rules are exempt with per-rule rationales, and 6
  known seam gaps are explicit `deferred` entries (including pagination and
  the missing-migration-history case, whose previously declared "runtime
  halves" did not actually refuse those violations). Tests fail closed on a
  missing, contradictory, or unresolvable classification, and the blanket
  "every rule has a runtime half" wording is retired from the platform docs.
  The spec repository's CI gains a `certify-against-reference` job that runs
  this repo's parity + corpus certification against every candidate spec
  change, closing the pinned-release adoption gap from the other side.

- **The Terp Standard's AppSec scope is explicit and the generic baseline is
  enforced (ADR 0085).** The catalog claims Terp-specific secure-architecture
  rules, not complete application security: generic vulnerability classes a
  stock analyzer detects well (command injection, unsafe deserialization,
  weak crypto randomness) are delegated to the mandatory ruff-bandit (`S`)
  baseline the platform repo already runs — and generated projects now
  inherit it (template `pyproject.toml` config + blocking CI step + an
  in-project ratchet that parses the stanza and pins the CI step), with
  `tests/guardrails/test_appsec_baseline.py` holding the delegation in place
  fail-closed and the template-acceptance job running the baseline on
  rendered output. Classes no stock analyzer detects (path traversal,
  secrets in logs, browser-storage auth material) stay addressed
  constructively, never claimed as detected. Baseline findings stay
  tool-attributed, never mapped to catalog ids.
